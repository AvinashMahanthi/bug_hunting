# the following code should output the set of number and its square!
#List of numbers
numbers = [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
#--Make your changes here--
pairs = [[x, x *2] for x in numbers]
print(pairs)


# The output should resemble like this
# [[0, 0], [1, 1], [2, 4], [3, 9], [4, 16], [5, 25], [6, 36], [7, 49], [8, 64], [9, 81]]
